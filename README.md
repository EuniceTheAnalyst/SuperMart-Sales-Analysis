## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
**1.1 Total Sales and Gross Income**  
Total Sales: $322,970 – This is the cumulative revenue generated across all branches, products, and customers within the reporting period.  
  
Total Gross Income: $15,380 – Represents the profit after deducting cost of goods sold, offering insights into pricing strategy and product profitability.  
  
These figures reflect a moderate level of financial performance, indicating both opportunity for growth and the need to optimize cost and product strategies.  

**1.2 Average Rating by Date**  
Average Customer Rating: 6.80 – A moderate satisfaction level on a 10-point scale. While not poor, it suggests room for improvement in areas such as service quality, product offering, or store experience.  

The line graph representing this data shows consistency, but no upward trajectory, suggesting stagnant customer satisfaction.

2. Sales Analysis by Product Line  
2.1 Total Quantity by Product Line and Gender  
The horizontal bar chart breaks down sales quantity by product line across male and female customers:  

Top Selling Categories:  

Fashion Accessories  

Food and Beverages  

Home and Lifestyle  

Both males and females show balanced purchasing behavior across most categories, although females show slightly higher activity in categories like Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty.  

Electronic Accessories and Sports & Travel were more popular among males, indicating possible demographic preferences.  

**2.2 Gross Income & Unit Price by Product Line**  
A scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between unit price and gross income:  

Food and Beverages and Home and Lifestyle offer high gross income at reasonable unit prices, suggesting strong sales volume.  

Electronic Accessories have higher unit prices but generate less income, indicating lower sales volume or market saturation.  

Fashion Accessories and Sports & Travel lie in the mid-range, contributing decently to revenue without leading in any metric.  

**2.3 Sales by Product Line and City**  
This visual compares the total sales quantity per product line across three cities:  

Naypyitaw leads in Fashion Accessories, Food and Beverages, and Health and Beauty.  

Yangon leads in Sports and Travel and Home and Lifestyle.  

Mandalay has a more balanced distribution but lower volume across all categories.  

These regional variations provide critical input for location-based inventory and marketing decisions.  
  
## 3. Geographical Analysis  
**3.1 Total Sales by City**   
City	Total Sales  
Mandalay	1,820 units  
Naypyitaw	1,831 units  
Yangon	1,859 units  
Total	5,510 units  

Yangon marginally outperforms other cities in terms of total quantity sold.  

The differences are small, indicating consistent performance across all regions, but localized marketing may further boost underperforming segments in Mandalay.  
  
## 4. Branch Performance  
**4.1 Total Sales by Product Line and Branch**    
Branch B is the highest contributor across nearly all product lines, consistently outperforming Branches A and C.   

Branch C shows the lowest performance across most categories, possibly indicating poor footfall, inefficient operations, or limited inventory.  

This insight can guide decisions related to resource allocation, staffing, and marketing investment per branch.  

## 5. Customer Demographics  
**5.1 Gender and Customer Type**  
Bar charts illustrate customer segmentation:  

Sales are nearly even across genders, suggesting balanced appeal of Supermart’s product offerings.  

Normal (non-member) customers contribute more to sales than members. This implies either a nascent or underperforming loyalty program.  

## Recommendations:  

Improve the membership program with exclusive deals, personalized promotions, or better point rewards.  

Analyze why normal customers aren’t converting to members—possibly due to lack of awareness or incentives.  

## 6. Payment Method Preferences  
**6.1 Sales by Payment Type**  
A donut chart shows distribution:  

E-wallet: $112.21K (34.74%)  

Credit Card: $109.99K (34.06%)  

Cash: $100.77K (31.2%)  

**Key insights:**

Digital payments dominate, indicating a tech-friendly customer base.  

The small margin between the three options suggests a diverse payment preference, and the business should maintain multiple payment channel support.  

## 7. Time-Based Sales Trends
**7.1 Average Total Sales by Date (Jan – Mar 2019)**  
Daily sales show relatively steady trends with slight fluctuations.  

No major peaks or troughs indicate consistent performance without seasonal spikes.  

This trend suggests stable customer demand and can help with inventory forecasting and staffing schedules.  
  
## 8. Strategic Recommendations  
Based on the dashboard analysis:  
  
A. Enhance Customer Experience  
Improve the customer rating (currently 6.8) by refining store operations, increasing staff training, and addressing customer feedback.  
  
Consider in-store surveys or focus groups to better understand pain points.  
  
B. Boost Underperforming Branches  
Branch C requires targeted interventions. Conduct an operational audit to explore location issues, staff performance, or inventory shortages.  
  
C. Expand Loyalty Program  
With members contributing less to revenue, a stronger loyalty program could increase repeat purchases and customer lifetime value.  
  
Offer tailored rewards, early access to sales, and gamified incentives to encourage signup and usage.  
  
D. Optimize Product Strategies  
Focus on high-grossing categories such as Food and Beverages and Home and Lifestyle.  
  
Consider bundling or promotional pricing for underperforming categories like Health and Beauty.  
  
E. Leverage Regional Insights  
Tailor inventory and promotions based on city-level preferences.  
  
For example, increase stock of Fashion Accessories in Naypyitaw and Home & Lifestyle items in Yangon.  
  
F. Drive Digital Payment Adoption  
Offer discounts or cashback for e-wallet or credit card usage to further shift customers toward faster, secure digital payment options.  
  
**Conclusion**  
Supermart exhibits a healthy sales ecosystem with strong digital adoption, balanced customer demographics, and consistent performance across cities. There are areas of improvement such as customer satisfaction, membership utilization, and underperforming branches. By leveraging data from this dashboard, the company can make informed, strategic decisions to improve profitability, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.
